# SOC Framework + CSOC JIRA Configuration Integration

## Overview

This document bridges the **SOC Framework v1.0** (7 analytics, 10 use cases, 8 automation rules) with your **detailed CSOC JIRA Configuration Guide** (100+ use cases, custom fields, workflows, Confluence integration).

---

## How They Work Together

### The Framework Provides:
- **Foundation**: 7 core analytics + 10 core use cases
- **Architecture**: Data flow, integration patterns, JIRA automation
- **Quick Start**: 30-day deployment roadmap
- **Playbooks**: Detailed UC-001 example + response procedures

### CSOC Guide Provides:
- **Depth**: 100+ use cases across all attack categories
- **Configuration Details**: Exact JIRA field definitions and workflows
- **Data Sources**: Comprehensive Windows Event and Sysmon mapping
- **Confluence Structure**: Shadow documentation and knowledge management
- **Best Practices**: Handling legacy systems, undocumented assets, policy violations

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Use Framework (Weeks 1-2)
**Deploy the 7 foundation analytics + 10 core use cases**

```
Start with:
├─ ANALYTIC-001 through ANALYTIC-007 (from Framework)
├─ UC-001 through UC-010 (from Framework)
├─ JIRA automation rules (8 rules from Framework)
└─ Basic custom fields (from Framework)
```

**Why this approach:**
- Get operational quickly
- Build analyst confidence
- Establish baselines
- Prove value to leadership

---

### Phase 2: Implement CSOC Configuration (Weeks 3-8)
**Expand with detailed CSOC fields, workflows, and 100+ use cases**

#### Step 1: Add CSOC Custom Fields (Week 3)

**From CSOC Guide - Core Alert/Incident Fields:**
```
Add to JIRA:
├─ Alert Rule Name (already have)
├─ Alert Source (Select: Search Head, SIEM, SOAR, Manual)
├─ Detection Query (Text Long - store full SPL)
├─ Search Head Link (URL - back to Splunk)
├─ First Seen / Last Seen (DateTime)
├─ Event Count (Number)
├─ Confidence Score (Low/Medium/High)
└─ Alert Disposition (9 values from CSOC guide)
```

**Add CSOC MITRE ATT&CK Fields:**
```
├─ ATT&CK Tactic (Multi-Select)
├─ ATT&CK Technique (Cascading)
├─ ATT&CK Sub-Technique (Text)
└─ Data Sources (Multi-Select)
```

**Add CSOC RE&CT Fields:**
```
├─ RE&CT Stage (Select)
└─ RE&CT Actions Completed (Multi-Select)
```

**Add CSOC Affected Assets Fields:**
```
├─ Affected Hosts (Text Long)
├─ Affected Users (Text Long)
├─ IOCs (Text Long - IPs, domains, hashes)
├─ Asset Criticality (Select)
├─ Asset Documentation Status (Documented/Undocumented/Legacy)
└─ Business Owner (Text)
```

**Add CSOC Change Management Fields:**
```
├─ Change Ticket Number (Text)
├─ Change Ticket Status (Select)
└─ Change Window Validation (Select)
```

**Add CSOC Investigation Fields:**
```
├─ Known Pattern? (Yes/No/Unknown)
├─ Previous Occurrences (Number)
├─ Shift (Day/Night/Rotating)
├─ Escalation Level (L1/L2/L3/Management)
└─ Sample Event (Text Long)
```

**Total Custom Fields Added:** ~28 fields
**Estimated JIRA Configuration Time:** 4-6 hours

#### Step 2: Update JIRA Workflows (Week 3)

**Replace simple Framework workflow with CSOC workflows:**

**Replace:**
```
Simple: Triage → Investigation → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Closed
```

**With CSOC Structure:**
```
Security Alert Workflow:
New Alert → Triage → Change Validation (or Investigating) → Resolved → Closed

Security Incident Workflow (promoted):
Identification → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned → Closed

Policy Violation Workflow:
Policy Violation → Pending Review → Escalated → Resolved → Closed
```

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

#### Step 3: Build Confluence Use Case Library (Weeks 4-8)

**Start with Framework Use Cases UC-001 through UC-010**
**Expand with CSOC categorized use cases:**

```
UC-001 to UC-010:   Self-Administration & Insider Threat
UC-011 to UC-017:   Privileged Access Abuse
UC-018 to UC-025:   Credential Access
UC-026 to UC-034:   Persistence
UC-035 to UC-045:   Execution
UC-046 to UC-053:   Lateral Movement
UC-054 to UC-059:   Collection & Exfiltration
UC-060 to UC-066:   Defense Evasion
UC-067 to UC-072:   Discovery
UC-073 to UC-077:   Orphaned Accounts
UC-078 to UC-082:   Undocumented Systems
UC-083 to UC-088:   Legacy Exploitation
UC-089 to UC-092:   Trust Abuse
UC-093 to UC-096:   Policy Bypass
UC-097 to UC-100:   Off-Hours Activity
UC-101 to UC-104:   Asset Violations
```

**Use Case Page Template (from CSOC Guide):**
- Overview + severity + MITRE ATT&CK
- Detection analytics + data sources
- Investigation steps
- Known false positives
- Tuning guidance
- Related playbooks
- Example alerts

**Content Development:**
- Week 4: UC-001 through UC-025 (25 use cases)
- Week 5: UC-026 through UC-050 (25 use cases)
- Week 6: UC-051 through UC-075 (25 use cases)
- Week 7: UC-076 through UC-104 (29 use cases)
- Week 8: Polish, cross-reference, validate completeness

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours per use case × 100 = 200-300 hours over 4 weeks (can be distributed across team)

#### Step 4: Implement Advanced Automation Rules (Week 5-6)

**Framework provided 8 basic rules. Add CSOC enhancements:**

```
From Framework (keep as-is):
1. Alert Ingestion & Enrichment
2. Use Case & RE&CT Mapping
3. Assignment & SLA Configuration
4. RE&CT Phase Progression
5. Evidence Collection Automation
6. Escalation Logic
7. Notification & Communication
8. Verdict & Closure

Add CSOC Advanced Rules:
9. Auto-populate ATT&CK from Use Case
10. Change Ticket Validation Reminder
11. Auto-link Related Alerts
12. Promote to Incident (Issue Type Conversion)
13. Documentation Enforcement
14. Baseline Learning (FP categorization)
15. Asset Documentation Update
16. Policy Violation Detection
17. Undocumented System Alert
```

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours per rule × 8 new rules = 16-24 hours

#### Step 5: Build SOC Asset Intelligence in Confluence (Week 6-8)

**Shadow IT documentation - what you discover through investigations:**

```
Confluence Pages:
├─ Servers (by hostname)
│  ├─ [HOSTNAME]
│  │  ├─ IP Address
│  │  ├─ OS Version
│  │  ├─ Business Owner
│  │  ├─ Services Running
│  │  ├─ Documentation Status
│  │  └─ Related Alerts
│  └─ ... (repeat for all discovered servers)
│
├─ Applications
│  ├─ [APP-NAME]
│  │  ├─ Function
│  │  ├─ Supported Servers
│  │  ├─ Account Requirements
│  │  └─ Related Alerts
│  └─ ... (repeat for all applications)
│
└─ Network Segments
   ├─ [SEGMENT-NAME]
   │  ├─ IP Range
   │  ├─ Criticality
   │  ├─ Known Hosts
   │  └─ Access Rules
   └─ ... (repeat for all segments)
```

**Build collaboratively:**
- Each alert mentioning new system → Document in Confluence
- Weekly review: Add 20-50 new systems to intelligence
- Link JIRA alerts to Confluence system pages

---

## Mapping Framework to CSOC Details

### Analytics Mapping

**Framework provides 7 core analytics. CSOC guide provides 104 use cases.**

```
Framework Analytic → CSOC Use Cases

ANALYTIC-001: Admin Group Addition → UC-001, UC-002, UC-003, UC-011 through UC-017
ANALYTIC-002: Suspicious Process → UC-035 through UC-045, UC-060 through UC-066
ANALYTIC-003: Failed Login Spike → UC-018 through UC-025 (brute force)
ANALYTIC-004: LSASS Access → UC-018 through UC-025 (credential access)
ANALYTIC-005: Lateral Movement → UC-046 through UC-053
ANALYTIC-006: Data Exfiltration → UC-054 through UC-059
ANALYTIC-007: Privilege Escalation → UC-026 through UC-034, UC-060 through UC-066
```

**Example: ANALYTIC-004 Expansion**

Framework provides UC-004 (OS Credential Dumping - LSASS Access)

CSOC guide expands with:
- UC-018: LSASS Memory Access (from CSOC guide)
- UC-019: Credential Dumping Tool Keywords (from CSOC guide)
- Plus UC-020 through UC-025 for other credential access techniques

---

## Custom Field Implementation Timeline

### Week 1-2 (Framework Phase)
**Minimal fields needed:**
- Use-Case
- MITRE-ATT&CK
- Severity
- RE&CT-Phase
- Playbook-Link
- SLA-Response
- SLA-Resolution

### Week 3 (CSOC Integration)
**Add comprehensive fields all at once:**
```
Total fields to add: ~28
┌─ Alert/Incident Core (10 fields)
├─ MITRE ATT&CK (4 fields)
├─ RE&CT Framework (2 fields)
├─ Affected Assets (6 fields)
├─ Change Management (3 fields)
└─ Investigation (3 fields)
```

**Implementation approach:**
1. Create all fields in dev JIRA
2. Test with 10-20 sample alerts
3. Train analysts on new fields
4. Deploy to production
5. Update all existing alerts (backfill)

**Backfill Strategy:**
- Prioritize CRITICAL and HIGH severity alerts
- Use bulk edit where possible
- New alerts auto-populate from Splunk webhook

- ✓ Analysts following playbooks
- ✓ Team confident with process

### Week 3: Add CSOC Fields (Transition Week)
```
- Monday: Add all CSOC custom fields to JIRA
- Tuesday: Configure new fields in automation rules
- Wednesday: Test with sample data
- Thursday: Update automation rules with new field logic
- Friday: Train team on new fields
```

**Minimal disruption:**
- Existing alerts keep working
- New alerts auto-populate more fields
- Team gradually learns new field purposes

### Weeks 4-8: Build Out CSOC Use Cases
```
- Continue deploying Framework analytics
- Start building 100+ use cases in Confluence
- Update automation rules with new logic
- Build SOC Asset Intelligence as discoveries happen
- Team becomes more effective with comprehensive knowledge
```

## Analyst Workflow with Combined Approach

### Simple View (Days 1-7)
Analyst sees:
```
Alert fires → JIRA ticket → Review UC-001 to UC-010 → Investigate → Close
```

### Enhanced View (Weeks 3+)
Analyst sees:
```
Alert fires → JIRA ticket (rich fields) 
├─ Check Alert Disposition field (9 categorization options)
├─ Review ATT&CK Tactic/Technique (auto-populated)
├─ Check Change Ticket Status (auto-validated)
├─ Review Asset Documentation Status (undocumented flag)
├─ Link to Confluence UC page (100+ deep use cases)
├─ Link to Related Alerts (auto-linked by system)
└─ Investigate with full context
```

---

## CSOC-Specific Enhancements to Framework

### 1. Policy Violation Handling
Framework provides incident response. CSOC adds:
```
New workflow: Policy Violation (not security incident)
├─ No Change Ticket
├─ Change Outside Window  
├─ Expired Change Ticket
└─ Policy Bypass

Separate from malicious incidents → Different escalation
```

### 2. Asset Documentation
Framework assumes documented assets. CSOC adds:
```
New custom field: Asset Documentation Status
├─ Documented (expected)
├─ Undocumented (discovered through investigation)
└─ Legacy (known older systems)

Generates Asset Investigation Requests for undocumented systems
```

### 3. Shift Awareness
Framework mentions 12-hour shifts. CSOC adds:
```
New custom field: Shift
├─ Day (06:00-18:00)
├─ Night (18:00-06:00)
└─ Rotating

Auto-assignment based on current shift
Handoff procedure between shifts
```

### 4. Shadow IT Discovery
Framework provides detection. CSOC adds:
```
Confluence: SOC Asset Intelligence
├─ Servers (discovered during investigations)
├─ Applications (unknown apps found)
└─ Network Segments (undocumented)

Built collaboratively over time
Reduces undocumented systems over time
```

---

## Detection Analytics Expansion

### Framework Provides (7 Analytics)
```
ANALYTIC-001: Local Admin Group Addition
