# SOC Framework Integration Guide

## Overview

This document explains how all framework components (Detection, RE&CT, MITRE ATT&CK, Playbooks, Runbooks, JIRA) integrate into a cohesive incident response system.

## Example: Complete UC-001 Incident Flow

### Starting Point: Raw Event Data

```
Windows Security Log 4728 Event:
  Computer: SERVER-001
  EventTime: 2025-01-15 14:32:00
  SubjectUserName: DOMAIN\admin-user
  TargetUserName: DOMAIN\new-user
  TargetGroupName: Domain Admins
  EventID: 4728
```

### Step 1: Detection (Analytics Layer)

**ANALYTIC-001 Query in Splunk:**
```spl
index=windows EventCode=4728 
| stats count by SubjectUserName, TargetUserName, Computer
| where count >= 1
```

**Alert Fires:**
- Alert name: "UC-001-AdminGroupAdd"
- Severity: "High"
- Host: "SERVER-001"
- User: "DOMAIN\new-user"
- Actor: "DOMAIN\admin-user"

### Step 2: Orchestration (JIRA Creation)

**Webhook Sent to JIRA:**
```json
{
  "alert_name": "UC-001-AdminGroupAdd",
  "severity": "High",
  "analytic_id": "ANALYTIC-001",
  "host": "SERVER-001",
  "user": "DOMAIN\\new-user",
  "actor": "DOMAIN\\admin-user",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:32:00Z"
}
```

**JIRA Automation Rules Execute:**

1. **Rule 1:** Create ticket
   ```
   Title: "[High] UC-001 - Admin Added to Group - SERVER-001"
   Description: (Auto-populated with alert details)
   Status: Triage
   ```

2. **Rule 2:** Enrich with use case
   ```
   Custom Fields Set:
   • Use-Case: UC-001
   • MITRE-ATT&CK: T1098.002
   • RE&CT-Phase: RA1xxx
   • Playbook-Link: 12-Playbooks-UC-001.md
   
   Comment Added:
   "Investigation runbook: UC-001 - Local Administrator Group Modification
    Contact actor and manager to verify legitimacy.
    See playbook for full procedure."
   ```

3. **Rule 3:** Set SLA and assign
   ```
   Custom Fields:
   • SLA-Response: 15 minutes
   • SLA-Resolution: 8 hours
   • Assigned-To: On-call-analyst-john
   
   Slack Notification:
   "🚨 [HIGH] Investigation assigned to @john
    UC-001: Admin Group Addition on SERVER-001
    Runbook: [link]"
   ```

### Step 3: Investigation (Analyst Uses Playbook)

**Analyst opens: 12-Playbooks-UC-001.md**

**Triage Phase (5 min):**
```
1. Validate alert in Splunk ✓
2. Check current group membership:
   > Get-ADGroupMember "Domain Admins"
   Result: new-user IS still in group
3. Quick assessment: Actor is known IT admin, timing is business hours
   Conclusion: Possible legitimate, needs investigation
```

**Investigation Phase (10 min):**
```
1. Contact actor (admin-user):
   "I need to verify a permission change at 14:32 today.
    You added new-user to Domain Admins.
    Can you explain the business reason?"
   
   Response: "Yes, we provisioned new-user as system admin
              per change request CH-12345. Manager approved."

2. Verify change ticket:
   Query system: CH-12345
   Status: APPROVED by Department Manager
   Approval date: 2025-01-14
   Implementation date: 2025-01-15 (today)
   Matches action ✓

3. Verdict: TRUE POSITIVE (but legitimate)
   Conclusion: This was authorized privilege change
```

**Update JIRA:**
```
Status: Investigation → Closed
Verdict: TRUE POSITIVE (Authorized)
Comment: "Verified with actor and change control.
          CH-12345 approved by manager.
          Action is legitimate."
```

### Step 4: Closure and Metrics

**JIRA Auto-Calculation:**
```
Metrics:
• MTTT (Mean Time to Triage): 3 minutes
• MTTD (Mean Time to Detect): 2 minutes (Splunk to alert)
• MTTC (Mean Time to Contain): N/A (no containment needed)
• MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve): 13 minutes
• SLA Response: 15 min target, 3 min actual ✓
• SLA Resolution: 8 hour target, 13 min actual ✓
```

**Lessons Learned (RA6xxx):**
```
Detection Effectiveness: ✓
  • Detection fired quickly
  • Playbook guided investigation
  • Clear decision made rapidly

Improvement Opportunity:
  • Could pre-check change tickets to reduce false positives
  • Filter: Alert + valid change ticket = auto-close in future

Implementation:
  • Update ANALYTIC-001 tuning
  • Add pre-check for change tickets in JIRA automation
```

## True Positive vs False Positive Example

### Scenario A: Same Alert, Different Context (FALSE POSITIVE)

```
SAME ALERT FIRES:
Event: new-user2 added to Domain Admins
Time: 2025-01-15 22:45:00 (off-hours)

TRIAGE:
• Off-hours suspicious ⚠
• Different admin actor ⚠
• No change ticket found ⚠

INVESTIGATION:
1. Contact admin-user2:
   "I need to verify a permission change at 22:45 today."
   Response: "I didn't do anything like that. I was home."
   
2. Check for compromised admin account:
   Look for other suspicious activity:
   • Multiple other groups modified?
   • Unusual logons?
   • Lateral movement?
   
3. Verification shows: admin-user2 account likely compromised

VERDICT: TRUE POSITIVE (Attack)

RE&CT EXECUTION:
→ Move to Containment (RA3xxx)
  • Reset admin-user2 password
  • Revoke new-user2 from admin group
  • Scan for lateral movement
  • Reset all admin passwords
```

### Scenario B: Same Alert, Different Context (TRUE POSITIVE)

```
SAME ALERT FIRES:
Event: new-user3 added to Domain Admins
Time: 2025-01-15 09:00:00 (business hours)

TRIAGE:
• Business hours ✓
• Known IT admin actor ✓
• Manager is known to request provisioning ✓

INVESTIGATION:
1. Contact admin-user:
   "I provisioned new-user3 today as per CH-12346.
    They're our new infrastructure engineer."
   
2. Verify CH-12346:
   Pre-approved admin onboarding request
   Approval: Director of Infrastructure
   Implementation: Same day as alert

VERDICT: FALSE POSITIVE (Legitimate)

JIRA CLOSURE:
→ Move to Closed
→ Document as authorized change
→ Update whitelist for future reference
```

## Quick Start Integration

### Day 1: Deploy Core Framework
1. Import custom fields to JIRA SOC-OPS project
2. Deploy JIRA automation rules (8 rules)
3. Configure webhook from Splunk to JIRA
4. Train team on basic workflow

### Week 1: Deploy First Analytics
1. Deploy ANALYTIC-001 to Splunk
2. Create test alert to validate workflow
3. Team walks through UC-001 playbook
4. Refine automation rules based on test

### Week 2-4: Expand Detection
1. Deploy ANALYTIC-002 through ANALYTIC-007
2. Establish false positive baselines
3. Refine SLA settings
4. Team practices additional use cases

### Month 2+: Optimization
1. Monitor metrics (MTTT, MTTC, MTTR)
2. Improve automation coverage
3. Expand to new use cases
4. Implement detection improvements from lessons learned

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Webhook Not Firing
```
Check:
1. Splunk alert action configured
2. Webhook URL is correct
3. JIRA authentication token valid
4. Network connectivity to JIRA
5. Alert conditions actually met in data

Debug:
- Check Splunk alert execution log
- Test webhook manually with curl
- Verify JIRA accepts incoming webhooks
```

### JIRA Automation Not Executing
```
Check:
1. Rules are enabled in JIRA
2. JQL filter matches issue
3. Actions are syntactically correct
4. API permissions granted
5. No conflicting rules

Debug:
- Review automation execution logs
- Test rule condition separately
- Check JIRA audit log for failures
```

### SLA Not Calculating
```
Check:
1. SLA time tracking enabled in project
2. Business hours configured
3. Custom field values populated
4. Issue in correct status
5. No SLA exemption applied

Debug:
- Verify SLA rules in project settings
- Check if issue is in SLA-tracked statuses
- Confirm business hours match environment
```

## Success Criteria

Your framework is working when:

```
✓ Alert fires in Splunk
✓ JIRA ticket auto-creates within 1 minute
✓ Custom fields auto-populate
✓ SLA timer starts
✓ Analyst receives Slack notification
✓ Analyst opens playbook in JIRA
✓ Analyst follows playbook steps
✓ Evidence collected in sub-tasks
✓ Verdict set in custom field
✓ RE&CT phase transitions trigger automation
✓ Incident resolved per playbook
✓ Metrics automatically calculated
✓ Lessons learned sub-task created
✓ Team reviews findings
✓ Detection/control improvements implemented
```

When all above are true, your SOC framework is operational and driving continuous improvement.
